# Introduction  
It turns out pCO~2~ is not a simple measure of the concentration (or activity) of CO2 in water, as it is strongly influenced by temperature.  Even at a fixed concentration of CO~2~ in seawater, there will be fluctuations in pCO~2~ due only to changes in temperature.

Here is an informal argument for why this is true:  At higher temperatures, CO2 is less soluble in sea water.  At equilibrium, partitioning of CO~2~ between atmosphere and ocean water will shift more CO~2~ to the atmosphere, thus raising the partial pressure of CO~2~ in the atmosphere that equilibrates with the CO2 in the water.

More formally, carbon dioxide (gas) in the atmosphere is in thermodynamic equilibrium with [CO~2~] in the water, (where I believe [CO~2~] refers to the sum of activities of CO~2~ and H~2~CO~3~ in solution).
$$ CO_{2(g)}  \stackrel{K_{0}}{\longleftrightarrow} [CO_{2(aq.)}]$$
Thus at equilibrium,
$$ fCO_{2} =[CO_{2(aq.)}] / K_{0}$$
where $fCO_{2}$, the *fugacity* of CO~2~, is "virtually equal to the partial pressure." Unfortunately, $K_{0}$ is not constant, but depends on temperature and salinity. One model for that relationship is the following (From Weiss 1974 but also cited elsewhere): 
$$ ln~K_{0} = -60.2409 + 93.4517(100/T) + 23.3585 \times ln(T/100) + 
S * [0.023517 - 0.023656 * (T/100) + 0.0047036 *(T/100)^2] $$   
(Note that temperatures need to be expressed in Kelvin)

# What do those equations imply?
Here we make a graph that shows the magnitude of the conversion factor ($1/K_{0}$), which converts from observed $pCO_{2} \approx fCO_{2}$ to $[CO_{2}]$ (from the last equation, above) over the range of temperatures and salinities we are mostly concerned with.  This shows how measured pCO~2~ will vary based on temperature and salinity changes alone -- even without actual changes in the concentration of CO~2~.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
Tc <- seq(1,20,0.5) 
S <- seq(20,35, 0.5)

test <- expand.grid(Tc=Tc, S=S) %>%
  mutate(T = Tc+273.15) %>%
  mutate(lnK = -60.2409 +
                 9345.17/T +
                 23.3585 * log(T/100) +
              S * (0.023517 - 
                   0.023656 * (T/100) + 
                   0.0047036 *(T/100)^2)) %>%
  mutate(K=exp(lnK), invK = 1/K)

ggplot(test, aes(x=Tc, y=S, z=invK)) +
  geom_contour_filled(color='white') +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = expression(frac(1, K[0]))) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*degree~C*')')) +
  ylab('Salinity (ppt)')
```

So, over the range of temperatures and salinities we are considering, the effect is mostly due to temperature -- if only because temperatures vary over ~ 20 C, while salinities vary only from ~ 22 ppt to about 32 ppt.  The overall effect of temperature and salinity could lead to a change in observed pCO~2~ of about a factor of two.

# Takehashi et al. 2002 Relationships
Takahashi et al. 2002 Used direct calculation of "temperature corrected" pCO~2~ as a surrogate for changes in CO~2~ concentration, and conversely, estimates of "expected" thermal pCO~2~, as estimates of the magnitude of the fluctuations in pCO~2~ one would expect to see due to temperature alone, if there were no changes in [CO~2~].

Equations from Takehashi et al. 2002 do not LOOK similar to the ones derived from the thermodynamic equilibrium relationship, above, but it turns out they are equivalent.  The Takehashi et al. 2002 equations are as follows:

#### "Expected pCO~2~" at Observed Temperature
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{obs}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{obs}- T_{mean})$$

#### "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~
$$(pCO_{2} \textrm{ at }T_{mean}) = (pCO_{2})_{obs} \times exp(0.0423(T_{mean}- T_{obs})$$

# Load Data
We use the Casco Bay data derived from the EPA collection of OA data from several NEPs.  This data includes calculation of temperature corrected pCO~2~.  We chose these data to start from (rather than our own internal CBEP version of the data) for consistency.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
the_data <-  read_csv("CB_oa_data.csv", 
     col_types = cols(X1 = col_skip())) %>%
  mutate(Year = format(DateTime, format = '%Y'))
```

## Temperature correction depends on temperature data
We have a couple of anomolous high temperature observations that appear to be outliers.  They may  represent a very low tide event on a hot summer afternoon, but I have not investigated further. I leave the data in the data-set, but note these values  to make the point that corrected values depend on both accurate pCO~2~ data and accurate temperature data.

```{r}
a <- which(the_data$Temp_meas==max(the_data$Temp_meas, na.rm = TRUE))
the_data[(a-2):(a+2),]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(a)
```

# Calculations
We calculate both the "thermal-only" an "temperature corrected" time series as calculated in Takehashi et al.  

1.  Calculate the expected thermal-only variation in pCO~2~.  This value (called "co2_thermal' here) is based on the average observed pCO~2~.  Since sampling is seasonally incomplete, this average is really just a reference value.  The logic, however, is that if the molar concentration of CO~2~ in the water column were constant, we would still see seasonal and diurnal variation in pCO~2~, simply because the solubility of CO~2~ is temperature dependent.  

2.  Calculate a "Temperature Corrected" pCO~2~ value ("co2_corr"). This is the converse of (1.). Here it provides a trace of changes in pCO~2~ that "would have happened" in the absence of temperature changes.  These reflect changes in the concentration of CO~2~, which reflect a combination of biology and diffusion of CO~2~ between ocean and atmosphere and advection past the sensor suite by tides and currents. Here we adjust pCO~2~ to a "standard temperature" of 12 degrees C.  This is slightly warmer than our observed average temperatures, and matches the temperature average used  temperatures.  Results should exactly match the value of CO2_Tcorr12.  


The logic is that if there were no biology (and no advection or diffusion between surface waters and the atmosphere), then co2_meas would equal co2_thermal, and co2_corr would be a flat line (within measurement error).  Neither is the case (see graphics, below) providing strong evidence that CO~2~ behavior in Casco Bay is influenced by system metabolism.  

```{r}
t_ref = 12
(t_mean = mean(the_data$Temp_meas, na.rm=TRUE))
(co2_mean = mean(the_data$CO2_meas, na.rm=TRUE))

the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(co2_thermal =  co2_mean*exp(0.0423*(Temp_meas-t_mean))) %>%
  mutate(co2_corr =  CO2_meas*exp(0.0423*(t_ref-Temp_meas)))
```
Thankfully, our calculations of temperature corrected pCO~2~  (cco2_corr) match the values in the data from EPA (CO2_Tcorr12).

The average temperature in our data is about 11.5C, partly because we have relatively little winter data.   More interesting, the average observed pCO~2~ is about 575 micro-atmospheres -- well above atmospheric averages of about 400 micro-atmospheres.

A quick check shows that the calculations in (2.), above, produced data that is linearly related to the calculations of [CO~2~] we ran based on the thermodynamic equilibria. These two ways of thinking about temperature dependence of pCO~2~ or [CO~2~] will give (nearly) identical results (subject only to a scaling factor).

# Exploratory Graphics
The following graphics show how the Takahashi et al. corrections look in Casco Bay.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(x=CO2_meas, y=CO2_Tcorr12, color = Temp_meas)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept=0) +
  geom_text(aes(x=1000, y=1200, label = '1:1 line'), hjust = 0) +
  xlab(expression(Measured~pCO[2])) +
  ylab(expression(Temperature~Corrected~pCO[2])) +
  theme_minimal()
```


Conceptually, the "correction" is adjusting for the natural effect of solubility on pCO~2~. Since pCO~2~ is higher at higher temperatures (Co~2~ is less soluble) the correction RAISES the value at low temperatures, and it LOWERS the value at high temperatures.

Overall it reduces apparent swings in pCO~2~, as the next plot confirms.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(x=DateTime)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_meas), color='blue', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_Tcorr12), color = 'green', alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab('Date and Time') +
  ylab(expression(pCO[2])) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct('2018-06-01'), y=1250, label='Observed = blue\nCorrected = Green')) +
  theme_minimal()
```
So the effect is to somewhat flatten out the seasonal swings in CO~2~.  Diurnal swings look less affected, although that is hard to evaluate from this plot. 

## If there were no biology, what would we see?
Here we compare predicted based on temperature alone, versus what we actually observed. 

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(the_data, aes(DateTime, group = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=CO2_meas), color = 'blue', alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(aes(y=co2_thermal), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x=as.POSIXct('2018-06-01'), y=1250, label='Observed = blue\nThermal Only = Black')) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('pCO2')
```


In spring we see pCO~2~ levels well below what we would expect only due to temperature, while by late summer and fall, water temperatures are beginning to drop again, but pCO~2~ stays high.  Also, it looks like diurnal fluctuations in pCO~2~ are substantially greater than would be predicted based on temperature alone.

That suggests:
1.  biological activity is removing CO2 from the water column in the spring, and returning it to the water column in the late summer and fall.
2.  Biological activity, perhaps related to photosynthesis, magnifies diurnal patterns.
